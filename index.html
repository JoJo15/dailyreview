            <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
                <h3>Educational</h3>
                    <p>For educational I remember getting an A+ on a test for the first time. It was the summer after my 8th grade year and I was taking Spanish 1. 
                    The test was a little difficult, but I was able to finish it confidently. 
                    When I got my test back it said I got a B+, and I was confused because I was sure that I got a A on it, 
                    so I told the teacher and she went over it again and she had seen the she made a mistake, and then I got an A+.</p>
                <h3>Personal</h3>
                    <p>For personal I was proud that I got a ps4 on my own. 
                    I started saving since December of 2014 and I have been saving up from getting money from grades, family, and even money I just found. It was May when I finally got enough money to pay for my PS4, 
                    and I went home proud and happy about myself for getting something that was so expensive, but it was worth it.</p>
